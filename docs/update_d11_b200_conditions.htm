        <b>NOTE:</b>
        <ul>
            <P>
                The 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0  release is not officially recommended to update the existing Deployment 1.1 !<p>
                Inofficially, you can do an update under the following conditions.
                <br>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>A. You have not done any modifications of your own in your current Deployment 1.1 installation</b>
        <blockquote>
            <li>Reason: There are lots of scripts that were modified in the 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0, and there is a high level of probability that copying these scripts into your 
                installation will replace your own modifications.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            <b>B. You are not using the Deployment 1.1 for any real application.</b>
        <blockquote>
            <li>Reason: Similar to point A above plus the revisions of the SQL queries for the PostgreSQL support may have introduced a high level of possible bugs.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            <b>C. You are willing to accept the possibility of experiencing more bugs and possible erratic program behaviour</b>
        <blockquote>
            <li>Reason: Same as the above.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            <b> D. You have to extend the database structure by loading the following sql dump scripts (for mySQL only):</b>

            <b>I have done own modifications in Deployment 1.1 but I still want to update it with 2nd Generation 2.0.0. Is there a safe way to do it?

        <ul>
            We recommend that you:
            <p>
            <li> Copy the 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0 scripts in a separate directory in your web server
            <li> Edit the /include/inc_init_main.php script and point it to your existing mySQL database for Care2x
            <li> Load the sql dump scripts listed at point D to extend the database.
            <li> Run and analyse 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0 and determine which modules and scripts will not conflict with your own modifications.
            <li> Copy these non-conflicting scripts to your Deployment 1.1 installation.
        </ul>
