The full documentation can be found in README, this is meant to be a quick
installation guide for people who don't want to bother the whole documentation.

Requirements
************

  Mandatory Items
  ---------------

   * PHP 4.0.0 or later with IMAP support (--with-imap) -- SEE NEXT SECTION
  
   * A Web server supported by PHP (i.e. Apache for most people)
  
   * An IMAP or POP3 server to connect to.

  Optional Items
  --------------

   * An SSL Web server to allow encrypted connections.
     (Apache+mod_ssl+OpenSSL is popular)

  Notes on PHP
  ------------

   * PHP needs to be compiled with IMAP support. (--with-imap at the configure
     stage).
     You'll find information on IMAP support for PHP at
     'http://www.php.net/manual/ref.imap.php'.

Installing NOCC
***************

  Installation of NOCC
  --------------------
       
       1) Download nocc-x.y.tar.gz (where x and y are version numbers)
	  (or nocc-x.y.zip for Windows' users).
	  http://nocc.sourceforge.net/

       2) untar/unzip nocc into the directory you want.
	  Default directory is nocc.
   
       3) Change into the 'nocc' directory, make changes to the 
          config file (conf.php.dist) and save the new one to conf.php
	  (remove .dist in the file name)

           'conf.php.dist' contains a large number of default values
           that you'll need to configure for your system, such as
           the default IMAP/POP3 server, whether or not users can pick a
           different server, etc...
	   The file is fairly well documented, so you should be able to pick
	   out what you need to change fairly easily.

       4) (Optional step)
	  if you run with suEXEC, you'll need to run './addcgipath path' to add
	  the parser line at the beginning of PHP files.

       5) Remove ./addcgipath.sh. For security reasons, it might be run by
          external users although "sh" files are never interpreted by Web
          servers with default configuration.

See README for more complete information.
