Frequently Asked Questions for Nocc
-----------------------------------

 Q. Nocc keeps me asking for a correct login/password.

 A. Check that you correctly configured your POP/IMAP server in conf.php
    ex:

    $servr = "mail.isp.com/pop3:110"; for a pop3 server

    and

    $servr = "mail.isp.com:143"; for an imap server

    NOT $servr = "mail.isp.com";

    -> Check that you're allowed to connect to the POP/IMAP server manually.
    Your ISP may not allow people based on the IP.

-----------------------------------
 
 Q. Having configured Nocc, I get this error with my favourite browser:

 A. Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imap_open()
    in /opt/apache/htdocs/nocc/functions.php on line 26

    -> Please check that PHP has IMAP/c-client support (you can use a small
    PHP script with phpinfo() to see what it supports).
    Check the on-line PHP manual to configure IMAP/c-client support

 Q. What is this UCB POP Server parameter in the configuration file ?

 A. It's the standard Unix POP server that shipped with early versions of
    various Un*x operating systems flavours.
    UCB stands for University of California/Berkeley
    You can check this by running the following:

    %telnet myhost 110
    Trying...
    Connected to myhost.berkeley.edu.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    +OK UCB Pop server (version 1.6) at myhost starting.
    quit
    Connection closed by foreign host.

-----------------------------------

 Q. I get session_destroy() errors when logging out of Nocc with PHP 4.0.3
    on Win32.
    Warning: Session object destruction failed...

 A. There's a known session_destroy() bug on PHP for Win32 < 4.0.4
    The problem only affects PHP Win32, not Unix.
    See the bug: http://bugs.php.net/?id=5231

-----------------------------------

 Q. Nocc is slow with a CGI version of PHP when there're big mails

 A. Unfortunately, we tried to optimize the code but some functions are
    clearly very slow in CGI mode. We hope this will be solved in future
    PHP releases.

-----------------------------------

 Q. The trashbox icon is not transparent on Netscape 4.x and some other
    browser.

 A. This is a known issue, Netscape 4.x doesn't support transparent PNG
    images whereas it's ok with GIF. We might switch to GIF again but we
    were wondering about license issues...

-----------------------------------

 Q. I get "Maximum time execution of 30 seconds exceeded" when loading
    a mailbox.

 A. It might be because the networks is slow, a large mailbox or having
    a CGI version of PHP.
    Increase max exec time in php.ini:

    max_execution_time = 300

-----------------------------------

 Q. I get "Warning: open(/tmp\sess_341b23452436243bfff454e5664756c67, O_RDWR)
    failed".

 A. Make sure you've created a valid directory in php.ini for sessions and
    make sure this directory really _exists_. :)

    session.save_path = c:\php\sessions

-----------------------------------

 Q. I get "Fatal error: Failed opening required 'lang/ en.php' [...]".

 A. This is a know bug from flawed PHP 4 install on RedHat 7.
    This is fixed with updated php-4.0.4pl1-6 RPM package or with Nocc 0.9.3
    which has a fix that suppresses extra spaces within this variable.

    See: http://www.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24933

-----------------------------------

 Q. When I tried to attach a file it says 'This server is not well set up !'

 A. This is because you didn't fill in the '$tmpdir' variable in conf.php
    and 'upload_tmp_dir' in 'php.ini'.
    NOCC needs at least one of these variables to be at up.

-----------------------------------

 Q. When I try yo attach a big file (>2M), I get a warning:
    "Max size of 2097152 bytes exceeded [...]"

 A. You have to increase the maximum file size in your PHP setup via php.ini:
    ; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
    upload_max_filesize = 2M
