The following are new in the Care 2002 beta 1.0.03 release: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. New modules 

	1. Diagnostics test and consultation request/scheduler. 

	The request forms to be filled up are "almost realistic" replicas of commonly used hospital forms 
	in Stuttgart, Germany to improve usability and user acceptance.

	There are forms for the following departments:


	- Chemical and serological laboratory
	- Bacteriological laboratory
	- Pathological laboratory
	- Blood bank, blood products
 	- Radiology department 
	   ( X-ray, Sonography, Mammography, Computer Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Tomography)

	There is also a "generic" form that can be used for the following departments:

	- Internal Medicine (ambulatory)
 	- General Medicine (ambulatory)
	- Emergency (ambulatory)
	- Sonography (ambulatory)
	- Nuclear diagnostics (ambulatory)

	2. Reception of the above described requests. 

	3. Documentation of the test results and findings.

	4. Features of the new modules.

		- Coupling to the visual event signaller at the patient's chart folder. 
		   Once test results or findings are written and stored, an internal event flag will be set to 
		   automatically signal that the results are available. 
		- The printouts are replicas of print format specially designed to be scanned by "binary code" scanners. 
		- The printout for chemical serological lab has additional barcode labels for labeling the specimen tubes. 
		- All forms and reports have a barcode label of its form (or batch) number. 

B. Validations and date - time formats 
	
	1. The date entries are validated by a javascript. Thanks to Thomas W. of Germany. 

	2. The date format is user selectable from the following three formats: 

		YYYY-MM-DD 
		DD.MM.YYYY 
		MM/DD/YYYY
		 
	3. The time format will be automatically set to HH.MM.SS for the german language. 
	    Otherwise it will be HH:MM:SS (default).
		
	4. The single "hot-key" entry of date and time values are now extended to other languages. 
		For example: "Today" hot-key for Spanish is "h" = Hoy, "Yesterday" is "a" = Ayer, "Now" is "i" or "y" = Ya. 
		The current defaults are "t" = today, "y" = yesterday, "n" = now 

	5. Validations in the pharmacy and meddepot modules: 
		
		- The no. of pcs. is validated against minus values. 
		- The no. of pcs. is validated against minimum and maximum order values. 

B. Visual Event Signaller (colored bar) 

	1. The automatic visual event signaller is now functioning. At present the event-to-color relationship is hard coded. 
	    This will be modified to be user configurable in the future versions. 
		
		- Once a new test request is sent to the diagnostics department, a colored bar (pale blue) will be pulled up 
		   at the patient's charts folder and the station's occupancy list. 
		- Once a test report for a particular patient is available, another colored bar (brown) will be pulled up. 
		- Once a new nursing report is written, another colored bar (blue) will be pulled up. 
		- Once a new query to the doctor is written another colored bar (yellow) will be pulled up. 
		- Once a new doctor's reply or instruction is written another colored bar (black) will be pulled up.

		- Resetting a color bar (pulling down) will not be done automatically but must be done manually by the 
		   responsible person. 

		- Other event-color relatioships that will be coded in the future will be: 
			- Green bar = once antibiotics are prescribed or included in the medication program 
			- Violet bar = once anticoagulants are included in the medication program 
			- Pale yellow bar = once diuritikas are included in the medication program 

C. Multiple format currency 
	
	1. The currency used for the prices can be user selectable 

	2. New types of currencies can be entered by the user 

	3. The time format will be automatically set to HH.MM.SS for the german language. Otherwise it will be HH:MM:SS.

	4. The single "hot-key" inputting of date and time values are now extended to other languages. 
		For example: "Today" hot-key for Spanish is "H" = Hoy, "Yesterday" is "A" = Ayer, "Now" is "I" or "Y" = Ya. 


D. Debugs 
	
	The following bugs are removed:
	
	1. "Same patient in several beds". 
	2. "Same patient in several stations".
	3. The scripts now "globalize" their variables once the register_globals of php is turned off.
	4. The error reporting is improved.
	5. "Missing file or broken image". The script will use the english language table once a particular language file is missing. 
	    The english version of an image or image control button will be used once the language specific image is missing.
	6. "Missing table for ICD/OPS data". The script will default to english ICD table if the particular language ICD is not available. 
	    It will also default to german OPS if the particular language OPS table is not available.
	7. "No link to database" in the nursing module. The nursing station table is not language dependent anymore.
	8. Plus many other debugs both minor and semi-major ones. 


E. Security improvements 

	1. Text inputs for documents are now filtered with htmlspecialchars() to prevent html tags to be parsed by the browser. 
	2. HTTP uploaded image files are now validated with isUploadedFile() function.
	3. Text inputs for news and nursing reports are filtered by deactivating the "hot" tags : <script>, <input>, & <form>. 
	     Other html tags are left unmodified to give the author a narrow way of formatting the text
		 (like bold, font size or color, etc.)


F. Restructuring of the user's access permission 

	1. The user's access permission is now displayed as a tree showing the hierarcy of the permission levels. 
	2. Configuration of the user's permission is simply done by checking the appropriate checkboxes.

G. Additional languages, modifications on the multiple language system 

	1. The available languages are (in alphabetical order) Brazilian(Portuguese), English, French, German, Indonesian, 
	    Italian, Polish, Spanish. Many of the language tables are not yet complete. 
		The script will default to english language table if the particular language table is not available. 
	2. The images and graphical control buttons will default to english if a particular language image or control button 
	    is not available.
	3. The news, menus, prices, documents and internal data contents are not language dependent anymore. 
	    All data contents will remain the same all throughout the different system languages. 

H. Changes in the database 

	1. All tables are now prepended with care_ .
	2. The mahopatient is now renamed "care_admission_patient".
	3. The mahopass is now renamed "care_users".
	4. Several tables were discarded and several new tables were added.
	5. Major modifications in some tables' internal elements.

I. Changes in the directory tree 

	1. All classes are now grouped inside the class/ directory.
	2. The "logs/" directory was moved to the root directory. This move lets the "main/" directory to be write-protected.
	3. The img/ directory was moved to a new gui/ directory.
	4. All common non-language dependent buttons and images were moved to new gui/img/common/default/ directories. 
	5. All language dependent control buttons and images were moved to new gui/img/controls/default/ directories.
	6. All mascot images were moved to the new gui/img/mascot/default/ directories.

		These moves are preparation for future enhancements on the theme based gui and user 
		
J. Miscellaneous additions 

	1. A credits window is now added. The listing order is dependent on the language being used.
	2. Webcamera is renamed "Video security" to explicitly state its function.
	3. The tags <?php ?> are now used consequently all throughout the entire program.
