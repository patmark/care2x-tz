        <b>The following are new in the Care 2002 beta 1.0.02 release:
        </b> <p>
            ****************************************************<br>
            The prompt about the browser type at the start of the program is
            removed.<br> The browser detection still works on the background for
            internal configuration purposes. <br>We would like to express here our
            philosophy of neutrality in view of several different fronts.<br>
            ****************************************************
        <p>
            1. The NULL problem which is a potential security risk is solved.
            For details about this vulnerability see the following links:  Thanks to avart_(at)_gmx.de.
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/5NP0C0K7QC.html">http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/5NP0C0K7QC.html</a><br>

        <p>
            2. The script locking system (script chaining) now uses an encrypted session id stored
            in a cookie.
        <p>
            3. A second level script locking (with encrypted session id) is now built in to protect
            "permission only" modules (double lock).
        <p>
            4. A third script locking (not encryted) adds to the difficulty level in the script locking system.
        <p>
            5. All cookies now have dynamic names coupled strictly to the session id to prevent conflicts
            which might arise when several instances of the same browser type is run simultaneously.
            This happens when several persons who have different access permissions or permission
            hierarchies work on the same workstation alternately within a particular time frame.
        <p>
            ***** Also to prevent the danger of "cookie spoofing" as pointed out by T.W.
        <p>
            6. The permission of a logged-in user are now checked in the background when he
            attempts to enter a protected module. His password is encrypted and stored in a cookie.
            Thanks to avart_(at)_gmx.de.
        <p>

            **** All encryptions are done using the HCEMD5.php class of PEAR. For comments
            and suggestions, please contact me.<br>
            **** I have noticed a very slight increase in the overhead due to the encryption process. 
            For comments and suggestions, please contact me.
        <p>
            7. The bugs in the following functions and modules are removed:
    <li> "Creation of new station" & "2 is greater that 10" bug. Thanks to T.W. of germany.
    <li> Generating the "fever and blood pressure graph". Thanks to A.A. of India.
    <li> Generating the "laboratory parameter results graph".
    <li> Generating the "operation times graph".
    <li> Displaying the headlines news. Thanks to T.W.
        <p>
            8. The generation of barcode labels is not cached anymore. Every barcode label is 
            generated fresh. Thanks to T.W.
        <p>
            9. The gd library is now detected dynamically. Thanks to T.W.
        <p>
            10. The buttons in the news editor modules are now graphical images. Thanks to T.W.
        <p>
            11. Sensitive sql queries are now protected with the "addslashes()" function. For details
            regarding this vulnerability see the links at item 1 above. Thanks to avart_(at)_gmx.de
        <p>
            12. All cookies are now called explicitly with the HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[xx]. Thanks to avart_(at)_gmx.de.
        <p>
            13. The initialize.php script can only be called once. Once the installation is completed
            this script will lock itself. 
        <p>
            14. The Photolab is now accessible only with password.
        <p>
            15. A potential security risk in the http uploads of image files via the news editor modules is
            solved. Only "gif,jpg,png" graphic formats are now accepted and stored.
        <p>
            16. The maximum file size of uploaded image via http is reduced to 1MB.
        <p>
            17. The telephone directory entries are now shown in alphabetical order.Thanks to A.A.
        <p>
            18. A new "include" directory is created. All the files in the old "req" directory were 
            renamed starting with "inc_" and moved to the new "include" directory. 
            Those who are merely updating their existing Care 2002 installation, you can delete the "req" directory 
            (this will not be supported anymore in the future) after copying the update files. 
        <p>
            Note: Other new directories created are:
        <p>
            /pear/crypt/   =  for the hcemd5.php  encryption class <br>
            /development/dev-docs/   = will house the docs for development guides etc.<br>
            /development/script-templates/  = will house the script templates for development
        <p>
            19. All include files are now protected from outside run attempts. Thanks to Luki.
        <p>
            20. The intranet email user registration now rejects the email address
            that is already registered.
