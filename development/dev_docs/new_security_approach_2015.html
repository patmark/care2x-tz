                The new implementation allows parent permissions to aquire all their children permissions.
                To add a new access area, you will need to modify the following files:
            </p>
            <p>
                care2x/global_conf/areas.php
                care2x/global_conf/areas_allow.php
                care2x/language/en/lang_en_access.php
                care2x/global_conf/areas_children.php
            </p>
            <p>
                The areas_children.php file is a new file which will let you define all the 
                children access permission belonging to a parent in an array.
            </p>

        </div>
    </body>
</html>
