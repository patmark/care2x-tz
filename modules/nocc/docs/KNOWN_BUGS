-------------------
Last updated: $Date: 2006/01/13 13:39:04 $

This is a list of known bugs for which we didn't have time to fix properly.
Please report bugs via SourceForge Project Web page.

 Bug: Nocc doesn't send correct "To:" header when sending mail via mail()
      function under Win32 platform only, when SMTP has not been configured
      within Nocc.

 Explanation: When Nocc isn't configured for SMTP on Win32, it will default
              using mail() which internally use a SMTP server (configured with
              php.ini).
              The code which is win32/sendmail.c isn't as full-featured as our
              own SMTP class.
              We believe this is a PHP bug, you can follow the bug here:

 Work-around: configure Nocc to use an SMTP server when using Win32.

-----------------------------------

 Bug: Nocc doesn't send mail giving a "Server Error" message when sending a
      mail with Cc: e-mail addresses using Win32 + mail() function only and
      PHP >= 4.0.5

 Explanation: Not yet, this does not occur on Unix systems, only with Win32
              when using the internal sendmail -> SMTP wrapper.
              It does not happen with mails without Cc: or Bcc: headers.
              Does not happen neither with PHP < 4.0.5

 Work-around: configure Nocc to use an SMTP server when using Win32.
