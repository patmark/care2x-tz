                <b>Setting an access permission</b><p>
                Due to high security requirements in health care systems, you cannot create an access permission all by yourself. The access permission
                is usually created for you by a designated employee in the IT department of your organization.
            <p>
                <b>What to do?</b>
            <p>
                Apply for an access permission through the official channels as outlined in your organization's rules and regulations.
                You can try the following contact information:<p>
            <blockquote>
                Name of designated person:<br>
                Department's address:<br>
                Telephone nr:<br>
                Fax nr:<br>
                Intercom nr:<p>
                    Application form
