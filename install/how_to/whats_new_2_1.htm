            <b>A. "Deployment" status</b>

    <li> Care2x uses the term "deployment" instead of "stable".
    <li> Why "deployment" ?
        <BLOCKQUOTE>Care2x is actually quite stable that it does deserve to be labeled as stable, but some language versions are not 100% complete.
            However, these incomplete language versions DO NOT hinder the reliability of the application.
